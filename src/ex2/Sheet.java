 * array of Cells, with get & set methods for each cell (int x, int y), as well as width, height of this SpreadSheet.
 * The main methods of the interface are:
 *
 * String eval(int x, int y), computes the actual String which should be presented in the x,y cell.
 *
 * eval(), computes the actual 2D array of Strings which should be presented of the SpreadSheet.
 *
 * int[][] depth(), computes a 2D array of the same dimension as this SpreadSheet, each entry holds its dependency depth.
